                                Job interviews can be stressful. The best way to prepare for a job interview is to anticipate—and prepare for—the questions you are most likely to be asked.
                                So instead of stumbling through a job interview trying to answer questions you didn’t anticipate, check out this list of frequently asked job interview questions so that you can practice articulate and convincing responses to each one of them.

                              <p><b>Introductory Questions</b></p>
                                The job interview will probably start off with some general introductory questions, such as:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>Can you tell me a little about yourself?</li>
                              <li>What do you know about our company?</li>
                              <li>How did you hear about this job?</li>
                              <li>What motivates you?</li>
                            </ul>

                                  <b>Questions About Work History</b><br>
                                  The interviewer will be very interested in your work experience and how that experience might translate for the open position. So expect questions such as:
                              </p>
                              <p><a href="blog4">YOU TOO CAN BE KNOWN</a></p>
